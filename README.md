# wze-uav classifying species specific crown condition by means of deep learning
Open-source repository to classify images of trees and predict their species and health status using EfficientNet B7. 
The images were previously extracted using findatree (https://github.com/FlorianStehr/findatree) using drone-based orthomosaics, digital surface models (DSMs), digital terrain models (DTMs), and shapefiles of the tree crowns. 

# Installation 
This package was developed using PyTorch and tested on Windows Server running python=3.9.
... gets updated soon
